- Ribbon Generator: Fixed a bug that sometimes caused words on
    the beginning of a line to lose their style information.
- Ribbon Generator: Fixed a bug that would cause letters to be
    lost when trying to hyphenate words that already contain 
    hyphens (which aren't sent to the hyphenation engine but

- MCA Editor: Add "Save and Close" button, "Save" now 
    returns to the MCA editor screen.

   ensure that the line can be completely quadded.
- Ribbon Generator: add 'Pad Margins' option that places
   a single quad at each end of a line, in order to ease
   transport of the finished type. Note that this reduces
   the length of type set on the line by the same amount.
- Added a new command: <allowtightlines></allowtightlines>
   that enables the use of combined space lines in lieu 
   of hyphenating a given line(s).

20130825
- Ribbon Generator: added "Go Back" button to Soft Proof
- Ribbon Generator: add hanging punctuation option. Note
   that this reduces the length of type set on the line by
   the amount of the hanging punctuation (usually the width
   of the smallest punctuation mark.)

20130814
- Stopbar Editor: added delete option for standalone tool.
- Ribbon Generator: added <nohyphenation></nohyphenation>.

  syntax:

  <indentN> where N is a positive or negative integer indicating
  the number of units to indent. Negative numbers trigger hanging
  indentation.

  Note: In order for the first line of text to honor indentation commands,
  the indentation command should appear before any settable text (and thus
  before the line is actually started, otherwise it will take effect on the 
  next line.

  Note: When pagebreaks are in play (ie, line length has been specified,) 
  this will force a blank line between headers and the top of the next 
  paragraph on the next page.

20121129
- Ribbon Generator: moved mca errors and available sorts to icons, in order
   to save screen real estate.

20121128

  word that would break a line causes an extra justifying space to be placed 
  on the line.

   within the matcase. Dragging a mat (a) onto another mat (b) will delete the
   mat you've dropped onto (b). Blue and Yellow coding in the MCA does not 
   yet follow when you use DnD.
- The Available Mats list will update itself when "floated" or "unfloated".
  
20110827

- Apply a new layout to the UI

20110601
- IMPORTANT: New standalone versions of the ribbon generator and caster 
     controller are available and support Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) only. My 
     only pre 10.6 computer died last month, so it will be practically 
     impossible to make the new tool available to non-intel Mac users. I can 
     still fix most kinds of bugs in the existing software, but I recommend 
     upgrading when possible.
- Each user gets private storage for mats and stopbars. Initially a copy of 
    all stopbars and matcases will be copied into each user's private area. 
    Each user may then delete any unwanted items.
- A user may mark a stopbar or matcase as "public", which allows them to be 
    seen and copied (but not modified) by other users.
- Stopbars and matcases may be downloaded to your own computer for safekeeping
     or manual modification (for experts only!)
- Stopbars and matcases can be imported from files on your local computer 
    (such as those exported from the standalone ribbon generator). Note that 
    you must make sure that any stopbar referenced by a matcase is already 
    loaded into the system before importing the matcase. failure to do so will
    result in an error.
- New ribbon generator option to treat lower and upper case characters as 
    equal when using small-caps
- New ribbon generator  option to allow substitution of roman punctuation 
    when setting italics and the italic alphabet is missing punctuation
- Soft proof will display sorts whose widths have been adjusted from the 
    standard wedge width on a colored background with an overbar above the sort.
- Caster Control and Ribbon Generator apps have a new "check for updates" 
    feature.

20110413
- standalone apps are now generated via build scripts for consistency

    proof
- ribbon generator: sort out hyphenation a little better (unnatural line 
    breaks in particular)

    ~/Library/Application Support, and copies fresh db if not present.

20100923
- ribbon generator: added <setpagenumber n> command.
- ribbon generator: added <romanpagenumber> and <lowercaseromanpagenumber> commands.

    illustrative style within "soft proof".
- ribbon generator: offset colors of adjacent fixed spaces within "soft proof"
    in order to visualize space sizes when quadding.
- ribbon generator: header and footer support - set line length in the ribbon
    generator and use the <header></header><footer></footer>, <eheader></eheader>,
    <efooter></efooter>, <oheader></oheader>, <ofooter></ofooter> commands to
    specify head and footer definitions for all pages, even and odd pages, respectively.
- ribbon generator: added <pagenumber> command to insert current page number.

20100817
- ribbon generator: add option to trip caster with long line
    at end of the job.

20100722
- ribbon generator: only allow adjustment of 1 unit for JS when
    working with set sizes larger than 12.
- ribbon generator: allow non-standard hyphenation, useful when
    generating "font" ribbons.

20100630
- ribbon generator: treat carriage returns a line feeds (no more
    mysterious justifying spaces at the beginning of lines)
- identified problem in hyphenation engine that drops trailing 
    periods from hyphenated words.

20100602

     quadding algorithm rather than sorting them by size. This should keep the mould 
     cooler when quading using 9 and 18 unit spaces.

- added list of identified problems to MCA design view
