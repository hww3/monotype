- Ribbon Generator: include Hyphenation engine again.
- Caster Control: Add 25ms of debounce to cycle sensor.

20120225
- Ribbon Generator: fix for problem where in an alphabet change around a 
  word that would break a line causes an extra justifying space to be placed 
  on the line.

20120112
- MCA editor: hopefully emit useful session information when no MCA is provided
- MCA editor: fix for ampersands, quotation marks and other special characters.
- Ribbon Generator: fix some problems with login
- Ribbon Generator: eliminate double encoding of UTF-8 specials, which was 
   causing garage characters on ribbon preview.

20120112
- MCA editor should now properly allow ampersands and similar marks to be
   set as matrix elements.

20111028
- Matrix editor uses a less intrusive popup mechanism that shouldn't run off 
   the page.
- MCA Description is now displayed and may be edited by clicking on the text.
- Available Mats can now be "floated".
- Both MCA Description and Available Mat boxes can be "folded up" to take less
   screen real estate.
- MCA Save button will be disabled until a change is made, making it easier to
   determine if you've done anything to an MCA
- Drag and Drop is now available within the MCA. In addition to dragging mats
   from the available mat list, you can now drag and drop mats between positions
   within the matcase. Dragging a mat (a) onto another mat (b) will delete the
   mat you've dropped onto (b). Blue and Yellow coding in the MCA does not 
   yet follow when you use DnD.
- The Available Mats list will update itself when "floated" or "unfloated".
  
20110827
- made some changes in the Ribbon Generator GUI for consistency: buttons, etc.
- fix an error thrown when creating new MCAs.
- fix for some characters (such as + signs) not being saved correctly in MCAs.

20110802
- Ligatures should now be applied to hyphenated word-parts.
- Fixed some bugs surrounding spaces at end or beginning of lines as well as 
    truncated single-syllable words when hyphenating.

20110620
- Fix a problem starting the standalone ribbon generator the first time
- Apply a new layout to the UI

20110601
- IMPORTANT: New standalone versions of the ribbon generator and caster 
     controller are available and support Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) only. My 
     only pre 10.6 computer died last month, so it will be practically 
     impossible to make the new tool available to non-intel Mac users. I can 
     still fix most kinds of bugs in the existing software, but I recommend 
     upgrading when possible.
- Each user gets private storage for mats and stopbars. Initially a copy of 
    all stopbars and matcases will be copied into each user's private area. 
    Each user may then delete any unwanted items.
- A user may mark a stopbar or matcase as "public", which allows them to be 
    seen and copied (but not modified) by other users.
- Stopbars and matcases may be downloaded to your own computer for safekeeping
     or manual modification (for experts only!)
- Stopbars and matcases can be imported from files on your local computer 
    (such as those exported from the standalone ribbon generator). Note that 
    you must make sure that any stopbar referenced by a matcase is already 
    loaded into the system before importing the matcase. failure to do so will
    result in an error.
- New ribbon generator option to treat lower and upper case characters as 
    equal when using small-caps
- New ribbon generator  option to allow substitution of roman punctuation 
    when setting italics and the italic alphabet is missing punctuation
- Soft proof will display sorts whose widths have been adjusted from the 
    standard wedge width on a colored background with an overbar above the sort.
- Caster Control and Ribbon Generator apps have a new "check for updates" 
    feature.

20110413
- standalone apps are now generated via build scripts for consistency
- caster control app now has preference for permanent cycle sensor install

20110405
- standalone ribbon generator stores logs in ~/Library/Application Support.

20110301
- ribbon generator: sort mcas and wedges alphabetically
- ribbon generator: add larger set widths
- ribbon generator: display adjusted width casts with an overscore in soft 
    proof
- ribbon generator: sort out hyphenation a little better (unnatural line 
    breaks in particular)

20110104
- standalone ribbon generator seems to work now; stores data in 
    ~/Library/Application Support, and copies fresh db if not present.

20100923
- ribbon generator: added <setpagenumber n> command.
- ribbon generator: added <romanpagenumber> and <lowercaseromanpagenumber> commands.

20100907
- mca editor: added bold elements to drag-n-drop.

20100823
- ribbon generator: added <pagebreak> command
- ribbon generator: added option to omit hyphen when using non-standard line breaks
    (useful for generating fonting e-ribbons.)

20100820

    illustrative style within "soft proof".
- ribbon generator: offset colors of adjacent fixed spaces within "soft proof"
    in order to visualize space sizes when quadding.
- ribbon generator: header and footer support - set line length in the ribbon
    generator and use the <header></header><footer></footer>, <eheader></eheader>,
    <efooter></efooter>, <oheader></oheader>, <ofooter></ofooter> commands to
    specify head and footer definitions for all pages, even and odd pages, respectively.
- ribbon generator: added <pagenumber> command to insert current page number.

20100817
- ribbon generator: add option to trip caster with long line
    at end of the job.

20100722

    working with set sizes larger than 12.
- ribbon generator: allow non-standard hyphenation, useful when
    generating "font" ribbons.

20100630
- ribbon generator: treat carriage returns a line feeds (no more
    mysterious justifying spaces at the beginning of lines)
- identified problem in hyphenation engine that drops trailing 
    periods from hyphenated words.

20100602
- caster controller: fix errors when using manual pin control before
    loading a ribbon file.
- caster controller: "all on" and "all off" buttons work properly with
    cycle sensor override.

     required number of fixed spaces to reach the total requested.
- ribbon generator: cast fixed spaces on the line in the order provided by the
     quadding algorithm rather than sorting them by size. This should keep the mould 
     cooler when quading using 9 and 18 unit spaces.
